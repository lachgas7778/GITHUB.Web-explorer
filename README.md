A framework to manage files from a server through the web

This framework is currently in work so you will get some alerts like "{something} is not installed".
It is not a point of money. These features will come sone.

Currently the framework is unflexible to install because I did not work on it.

Currently working on minify all and make it flexible.

  Responsive:
  
    minimum size:
      height:400px;
      width: 200px;

    maximum size
      unlimited 

  Coming soon
  
    1. flexibility
    2. easier to install
    3. plctures to explain the do's and don'ts
